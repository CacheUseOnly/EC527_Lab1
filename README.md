## Part 1

### 1a.

**1048576** bytes of memory give the highest bandwidth. \
Besides, **262144** bytes gives a very similiar bandwidth.

### 1b.

**67108864** gives the lowest.  \
The ratio between the highest and the lowest is 1.19 

### 1c.

16 Tasks with 262144 Bytes give the highest total bandwidth. \
16 Tasks with 1048576 Bytes gives a similliar bandwidth.

### 1d.

The bandwidth achieved when running just one task with largest memory size is 3.069e+10. The bandwidth per task achieved closest to this bandwidth when running multiple tasks is **1.81e+10**.
